# Kill Spikes
I made Kill spikes for mobs and animals. The inspiration was the mobtrap from Minecraft.
Improve your base defense with wood, iron and diamond spikes around.

What it can handle:
Wood spikes: 2-3x kills, 
Iron spikes: 8-10x kills, 
Diamond spikes: lasts very long...

After destroying the spikes and digging them out you will get:
From wood spikes: 3 sticks, 
From iron spikes: 2 iron ingots, 
From diamond spikes: 2 diamonts.
